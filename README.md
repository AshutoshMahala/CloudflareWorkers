![Cloudflare Wrangle Demonstration](https://github.com/AshutoshMahala/CloudflareWorkers/blob/main/media/wrangler.gif)


A Simple demonstration of Cloudflare Worker using wrangler which can be used to content delivery
This can provide faster delivery of the content as the server nearer to the user.
Multiple types of content can be used. In this demostration. I'm using a static html content and json content and dynamically modified content which can save a lot of load frmo the real server.
